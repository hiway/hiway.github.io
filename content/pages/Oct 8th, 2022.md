This is a test.

  + A tiny test.

What if I published a [Logseq]({{< ref "/pages/Logseq" >}}) graph as my personal website?

  + A [digital garden]({{< ref "/pages/digital garden" >}})!

Let's see what makes more sense - a [Hugo]({{< ref "/pages/Hugo" >}}) theme or the whole [Logseq]({{< ref "/pages/Logseq" >}}) web-app.

  + The [Hugo]({{< ref "/pages/Hugo" >}}) theme is very appealing because it is not bandwidth hungry.

  + And it works without [JavaScript]({{< ref "/pages/JavaScript" >}})!

  + Okay, with the exception of one concern - I'm not sure I like the latest-notes approach, can be quite confusing for a new visitor.
