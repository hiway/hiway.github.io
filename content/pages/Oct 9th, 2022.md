01:26 - Let's try working on a public Logseq graph

  + I'm thinking of publishing my bookmarks and notes here.

01:28 - Let's begin with the tools I used to publish this site

  + [Logseq](https://logseq.com/)

  + [Logseq Schrodinger](https://github.com/sawhney17/logseq-schrodinger)

  + [Logseq Hugo Template](https://github.com/CharlesChiuGit/Logseq-Hugo-Template)

  + [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)

  + [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

01:35 - However, knowing myself:

  + Clicking menus to export a zip file

    + and then committing to git to publish

    + sounds like a little more friction than I'm willing to overcome daily.

  + Add to that the fact that

    + You can only have one Logseq graph open at a time.

  + I'm not certain if I'll continue to use this as regularly as I wish.
